# Propel2

Propel2 is an open-source Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) for PHP 8.0 and up.


## Requirements

Propel2 uses the following Symfony2 Components:

* [Console](https://github.com/symfony/Console)
* [Yaml](https://github.com/symfony/Yaml)
* [Finder](https://github.com/symfony/Finder)
* [Validator](https://github.com/symfony/Validator)
* [Filesystem](https://github.com/symfony/Filesystem)

Propel2 also relies on [**Composer**](https://github.com/composer/composer) to manage dependencies but you
also can use [ClassLoader](https://github.com/symfony/ClassLoader) (see the `autoload.php.dist` file for instance).

Propel2 is only supported on PHP 8.0 and up.
